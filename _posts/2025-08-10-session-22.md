## Keeping our memories 

The gang votes and decides to take the Flask of Eternal Options, putting the other items back. Noctus secrety takes the Figurine of Wonderous Power with the help for Torque. Ariel realizeds that Shadowpaw does still have the deamons with thim but DOES NOT remember the monestary, Master Claw, or strawberry. She is DEEPLY concerned and sprints to the ship to avoid memory loss. 

Avö is already on the ship, she left after almost dying in the fight and has locked herself into her room. Ariel breaks in and looks for help to understand what happened with Shadowpaw but Avö needs space. 

Everyone makes it to the ship on time. Noctus hears a laugh, checks his pockets, and the horse figurine is gone. The Atherial people had said the island would only let us take one wonderous item. 

Ariel gets a message from her mom that Beliene has arrived and is custody. Ariel shares that many people are going missing looking for the Mermaid tears, she is told they should meet up in person. 

It's about time to meet everyone in Fort Kylo but.... the gang needs supplies. The decision is made to stop by Windcrown. Avö comes up with many excuses to avoid this but is not able to convince the group. On there way, they see 3 pirate ships attacking a merchant ship that is flying Windcrown and Caldere flags. 

## Ship fight 

With some alturism and some piracy, the decision is made to attack the pirate ships. Andujar recognizes them as the Thorn Nights. The group takes down the three ships, mostly one at a time. The merchant ship flees. Many are on the top of their game, improving their skill with flashes of inspiration. 

The crew notices that something suspicious is going on, this is not actually the Thorn Nights. After direlecting all three ships, Felix uses detect thoughts while Ariel and Avö attempt to lead the witness with comments about "The Thorn Nights" and "Attacking the Caldere refill vessel". Many think "haha they believe it". 

Things continue to seem fishy with the captain even thinking about how some of the pirates got away - but only the merchant vessel got away... what is going on. The merchant vessel has changed course and appears to be sailing back towards Windcrown, the crew will follow after a day of looting the ruined ships. 

Felix sends a message to Vic, warning them that pirates pretending to be well known pirates are on the incoming merchant vessel. Vic replys that this is weird because the bi-annual restock has already happened recently. 

We easily get the crew and ship up to full health but we are now **very low** on ship repair supplies.

* 5,900 GP to the bag of holding
* 3 days of food / water supplies 
* 2K GP worth of art
