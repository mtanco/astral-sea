#### Cook
Cook (role): GROG! (Crew Morale): Crew morale starts at +0 When initiative is rolled, roll your sailing die + rank. The crew morale is modified by the number corresponding with the amount rolled  (0-5 -2), (5-10 -1), (10-15 +1), (15-20, +2), (20-25, +3), (25-30 +4), (30+ +5). Can use the GROG! action to roll your sailing die and raise crew morale by +1 passing out emergency rations of grog until the end of your next turn. When you reach rank 2 in this role Crew morale will start at +1, Rank 5 morale starts at +2.

#### Navigator
Navigator (role): Full Sail/Come About (Ship movement) Makes navigation Survival or Acrobatics checks out of combat. Can use the Full Sail action to Increase the ships movement by an amount of feet equal to 10x Sailing die + rank + Crew Morale rounded down to the nearest 50. Can use the Come About Action to rapidly turn the ship. The ship gains an extra rotation this turn. At rank 5 in this role you can use both Full Sail and Come About in 1 ship action.

#### Master Gunner
Master Gunner (role): Fire! (Ship Damage): Can make the FIRE! action. Make an attack roll(s) using the ships weaponry. You can make a number of attacks equal to your crew morale (minimum 1). Add your sailing die to the first attack roll as a bonus to hit the target. If there are multiple gunners, each players sailing die can be added to one attack each. Damage determined by the type of weapon/ammo. Ranks in this role allows for use of more advanced weaponry. If there are multiple master gunners, the highest rank will be used when determining weapon proficiency.

#### Boatswain
Boatswain (role): Repair/Give ‘er All She’s Got (Ship Heal): Make a Arcana or Athletics check adding your rank to the role (d20+ability bonus+rank) DC 15 to Give ‘er All Shes Got and remove the stressed condition from the ship until the end of your ships next turn. OR Use the repair action to put out a fire or Heal the ships HP equal to your Sailing die + Rank + Crew Morale. (Minimum of 1) At rank 5 in this role when you use the Repair action on a derelict ship you heal it for the amount rolled instead of 1hp. 

#### Surgeon
Surgeon (role): Patch Up (Crew Heal): The surgeon can use the Patch Up action to roll their sailing die + rank + Crew Morale to get that many crew members back in the fight possibly removing the stressed effect from the ship. If the amount 20 or higher add +1 to crew moral. -1 crew morale for every 5 injured crew. At rank 5 in this role when you roll a 20 or higher while using the Patch Up action you heal your crew to half of the maximum amount +1.


### Other actions!

If you are not taking a ship action associated with a role, you can take a character action using your ships initiative. ie making a ranged attack with a musket against a member of the crew aboard another vessel, or casting fireball, using a magic item, etc.

Boarding (1 ship action) 
You can attempt to board a ship at any time. Your ship must be in an adjacent square. Each ship makes an opposing strength check (grapple). A grappled ship can’t move, or rotate, and makes any cannon attacks at disadvantage. A derelict ship automatically fails this check. This can trigger a battle, or social encounter, some ships may even fully surrender.

### Elected Roles

#### Captain 
Once per combat the captain can add their sailing die to any roll of their choice. This can be done after the initial roll is made. 

#### Quartermaster
Once per turn the quartermaster can push the crew. The ship gains an extra action point this turn, but loses one the following turn.

#### Lookout
While the lookout is in the crows nest the ship has +1 AC, but the lookout can take no role actions while in the crows nest (can still use player actions) climbing in or out of the crows nest takes 1 turn.


### Ship Conditions

#### Stressed
When a ships crew is at or below half its maximum number it becomes Stressed. When a ship is stressed ALL ship action rolls are made with disadvantage.(D20 only, sailing die are rolled normally)

#### Derelict
When a ship reached 0 hp it has the Derelict condition. A Derelict ship can only use the repair action, this can only bring the ship back to a maximum of 1 hp.

If a ship takes damage while under the derelict condition, roll a d20, the ship sinks on a 10 or lower.

A derelict ship can drift on the aether depending on the situation. But cannot move on its 

If a ship is derelict and has the minimum amount of crew (1). Cannot use any ship actions for 24 hours.
